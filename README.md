# Hellas Protocol Prototyping Sandbox

Here will be the garden where we grow the `hellas-core` crate while experimenting with protocol designs and implementations.

Guiding principles:

- High throughput
- Minimize coordination (avoid the chain in the hotpath)
- Fixed-functionality over needless flexibility
