# Hoare Logic Verification for Morpheus Protocol

This module develops a verification framework based on Hoare logic and protocol invariants
to prove that:

1. The optimized data structures correctly implement the protocol state
2. The fastpath optimizations maintain safety while improving liveness
3. The protocol satisfies key invariants in both implementations

We use weakest preconditions to precisely characterize what's needed for each
protocol step to maintain correctness.
