(** * Morpheus Consensus Protocol Formalization

    This is a formalization of the Morpheus consensus protocol as described in
    "Morpheus Consensus: Excelling on trails and autobahns" by Lewis-Pye and Shapiro.
    
    The protocol is designed to excel in both low-throughput (leaderless) and
    high-throughput (leader-based DAG) settings.
